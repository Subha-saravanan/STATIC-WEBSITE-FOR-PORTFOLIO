# 🌟 MY DEVELOPER PORTFOLIO

Hi there! 👋  
I’m **Subha**, and this is my personal developer portfolio — a one-stop digital hub that says,  
**“Hey, I code. I create. And yes, I can fix that bug too!”** 🧑‍💻💪

---

## 🧰 TECH STACK & TOOLS USED

Here's everything that powered this beautiful mess (I mean, masterpiece 😄):

- **HTML5** – Structured the skeleton of the site like a digital architect 🧱
- **CSS3** – Styled it with flair (animations, hover effects, light/dark mode – you name it) 💅
- **JavaScript** – Gave life to the site! From smooth scrolling to animated typing 🎯
- **VS Code** – My code playground 🧠
- **Git & GitHub** – For version control and hosting like a pro 👨‍🚀
- **Google Fonts** – Because basic fonts are boring 📚
- **Canva** – For designing icons and assets (and occasional resume touch-ups 😄)

---

## 💻 PLATFORM USED

- Developed entirely on **Visual Studio Code**
- Hosted and proudly displayed on **GitHub Pages**
- Tested across devices — from chunky monitors to tiny smartphones. Responsiveness? ✅

---

## 🌐 WHAT'S THIS SITE ABOUT?

This is my **digital identity**, created to:

- Show off my **projects**, **skills**, and **learning journey**
- Give a glimpse of **who I am** beyond just lines of code
- Make it easier for recruiters to say: *“Let’s call this candidate!”*

---

## 📍 WHERE IS THIS APPLICABLE?

- **Job Interviews** – Because first impressions count
- **Hackathons & Project Submissions** – Instant access to all my works
- **Freelance/Collab Work** – Proof that I walk the tech talk
- **Resume Link** – Makes your PDF resume way cooler

---

## 🧠 WHAT I LEARNED

Building this wasn’t just HTML tags and curly braces. Here’s what I truly learned:

- 🕹️ **How to make websites responsive** — no matter the screen size
- 💡 **How to write clean CSS** without going bald from frustration
- 🌙 **How to implement dark/light mode** (and finally understand `localStorage`)
- 🧩 **How JavaScript really works** behind animations and toggles
- 🎯 **How to break big tasks into small achievable goals**
- 😅 And yes, **how to Google error messages like a pro**

---

## 🤹‍♂️ FUN FACT

> I spent more time adjusting button shadows and font sizes than writing my final year project.  
But hey — perfection is a journey!
